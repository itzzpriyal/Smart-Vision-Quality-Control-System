# Node.js Smart Vision Quality Control System

This project implements a basic Smart Vision Quality Control System using Node.js. It demonstrates image preprocessing, text extraction, expiry date checking, and object counting.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- OpenCV (for opencv4nodejs)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run npm install to install dependencies

## Usage

1. Place your test image in the project directory
2. Update the imagePath in index.js to point to your image
3. Run npm start to execute the program

## Features

- Image preprocessing
- Text extraction using OCR
- Expiry date checking
- Object counting

Note: This is a basic implementation and may require further development for production use.
